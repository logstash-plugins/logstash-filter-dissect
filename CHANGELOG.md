## 1.2.1
 - [DOC] Added note to clarify notation for dot or nested fields [#76](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-dissect/pull/76)

## 1.2.0
  - Fix Trailing Delimiters requires a false field. A skip field is
  automatically added when a final delimiter is detected in the dissect pattern.
  This requires that strict delimiter finding is enforced  - meaning a "no match"
  results if every delimiter is not found in exactly the declared order
  [Issue #22](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-dissect/issues/22)
